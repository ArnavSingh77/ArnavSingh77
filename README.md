I am a person who is in love with coding. I love to code Python, HTML, TailwindCSS, Flutter, etc. The irony is, I am a noob at everything.

But, there is one thing that I do know, how to eat food; I can teach you that!

Jokes Aside,
Hello and welcome to my GitHub account! I'm passionate about programming and technology. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects and experiments with code. I'm still learning and growing as a coder, so feel free to provide feedback and suggestions.

I started coding as a hobby and quickly became fascinated by the limitless possibilities of what I could create with code. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills. From simple games to more complex applications, I enjoy using code to bring my ideas to life.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub Repo! I hope you'll find something here that interests you.
